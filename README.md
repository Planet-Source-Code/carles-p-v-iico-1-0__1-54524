### Description

All formats icon/cursor editor. 

----

Important: This application has been tested under Windows XP/2000 (NT?). Because of GDI limitations in Windows 9x with geometric* pens, 'brush', 'line' and 'shape' tools will not give desired final appearance. [*Using geometric pens with Paths will end with same results]. 

----

Yes, this little application is still far of some well known professional ones, but, I think is quite complete for a first release, as well as a good example of GDI and GDI+ joining. // All thanks to Avery and Vlad V. // Zip 165 Kb



----

Update 2004.06.28: Fixed W9x memory leak. Thanks Vlad! (and thanks Fred, for all your tests). // Alpha effects now available on selection frame. 

----

Update: See CodeID=54968 (NT/2000/XP).
